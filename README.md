JFractGen
=========

A Julia/Mandelbrot Fractal generator written in Java/Swing.

This is just a weekend / Hobby project of me. At the moment the code and output is
in a very early stage, let's call it "0.1-alpha", if already. Give me some time :-)

Main class: ch.alexi.fractgen.Main


Planned / future features
==========================
- JSON export of presets
- define user-presets in json config file
- graphic export/conversion
- multiply color palette
- more presets
- drag-move
- julia set K-parameters
- smooth colors

NOTE(s)
=======
This code contains the Forms layout classes from http://jgoodies.com
